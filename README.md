# Python CUDA Packages

This repo maintains a number of Python packages requiring CUDA compilation for compatibility with recent CUDA & PyTorch versions.

To determine appropriate `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` content in `setup.py` for your GPU, please refer to [CUDA GPU Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

To install a package, use `pip3 install .` in the corresponding folder.
